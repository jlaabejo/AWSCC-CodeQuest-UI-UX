_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: Lazada is where I can easily find products that I am looking for as it has minimal designs and will direct me to the products or related products that I would possibly like and buy.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: Advertisements and feature panels like for refunds, daily coins, and send money that display on the main page of the app are possible to bring confusion and distraction to the users. 

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer:

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee has more vibrant and visually appealing that emphasizes product images and lively layout, compared to Lazada that has a more organized, structured and straightforward design.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer:
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: Although Shopee is visually appealing, its overall orange color makes its interface messy, while Lazadaâ€™s combination of white and other accents of color is easy on the eyes and that might be preferable.
